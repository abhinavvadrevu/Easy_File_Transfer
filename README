Easy File Transfer

This project allows the user to transfer files to friends connected to the same network. It was created because I often found myself wanting to transfer small files like word documents to friends sitting next to me.  I rarely carry a thumbdrive on me, so in order to avoid the pain of opening up gmail every time I want to send a file to a friend, I created this little app.

This app has a folder called My_Docs which acts a virtual thumbdrive.  Every time the server is started, a tinyurl is created so the user can easily tell his friends where to navigate to.  The friends can see all the files currently in the My_Docs folder, and can both download and upload to it.

This app is better than using a thumbdrive or gmail for the following reasons:
- it is safer than a thumbdrive since users cannot edit or delete the files in My_Docs, unlike with a thumbdrive, so the user will not lose work
- There are no file size limits
- I need not remember to bring a thumbdrive around with me
- it is faster than gmail
- gmail doesn't allow transfer of executables, which can be done here
- gmail also involves a lengthy upload process which is eliminated here

This project uses Tornado.
